## 🛠️ How to Contribute

> Please follow these steps carefully and with humility.

### 1. Get Approved
Before you clone or work, make sure:
- You’re **assigned to the task** by the ICT Head or ICT Secretary
- You’ve **read and understood** this guide

### 2. Fork the Repo or Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
````

### 3. Follow Our Code Standards

* Use the defined stack (e.g., Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript)
* Follow naming conventions and folder structures
* Keep PRs small and focused

### 4. Write Meaningful Commits

```bash
git commit -m "feat: added theme toggle to header"
```

Use prefixes like:

* `feat`: new feature
* `fix`: bug fix
* `docs`: documentation update
* `refactor`: cleanup without changing logic
* `chore`: tooling, configs, etc.

### 5. Open a Pull Request

* Push your branch
* Go to GitHub and open a **Pull Request**
* Add a brief description
* Request review from the ICT Head

### 6. Review & Merge

* Wait for at least **one approval**
* Coordinator or ICT Head will approve and merge

## 🧼 Code of Conduct

This is more than a codebase — it’s a ministry.

* ❌ No pride or ego
* ✅ Encourage, correct, and teach others in love
* ✅ Always pray before major tasks — invite the Holy Spirit

## 🙏 Final Thoughts

We don’t just ship features — **we build tools that advance the Kingdom** on campus. Every file, line, and commit must reflect the excellence and purity we preach.

Let’s build **with order**, **with love**, and **unto the Lord**.

> “Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it.” – Psalm 127:1
